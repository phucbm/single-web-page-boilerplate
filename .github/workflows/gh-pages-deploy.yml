name: GitHub Pages Deploy
# How this workflow works?
# Every time you push to the "main" branch
# GitHub Actions will build your project to the "gh-pages" branch
# Then deploy a GitHub page from that branch
# Edit the branch name or npm command to fit your project

# Setup GitHub Pages
# Go to your repo Settings > Pages
# Select Source: Deploy from a branch
# Select "gh-pages" branch at "/(root)", then Save

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    # Review gh actions docs if you want to further define triggers, paths, etc
